// TASK 1:
// Make simple calculator app that asks the user for operation to make
// The application will parse the given operation and call the appropriate function
// from the math module.
// The application will then print the result to the console.
// The application will then ask the user if they want to continue.
// If the user wants to continue, the application will repeat the process.
// If the user does not want to continue, the application will exit.

// TASK 2 (Bouns 50 points):
// Make a guessing game that asks the user to guess a number between 0 and 50.
// The application will generate a random number between 0 and 50 using the randomTo50 function.
// The application will then ask the user to guess the number.
// The user has 5 attempts to guess the number. if the attempt is wrong, the application will print "Try again ðŸ¤”" to the console.
// If the user does not guess the number correctly 5 times, the application will print "You lost the game!! try again ðŸ¤”" to the console.
// If the user guesses the number correctly, the application will print "You won the game!! congrats ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³" to the console.

// TASK 3 (Bouns 50 points):
// Make a function that ask the user the following questions:
// 1. What is your name?
// 2. What is your age? (if age is not a number or is less than 10, the application will print "Invalid age" and end the program)
// 3. What is the Favorite programming language
// Then after the user answers all the questions, the application will print the following.
// console.log("\n--- Summary ---");
// console.log(`Name: ${name || "(no name)"}`);
// console.log(`Age: ${age}`);
// console.log(`Favorite language: ${fav || "(not specified)"}`);
// console.log("----------------\n");
